Despite a shrinking number of subscribers and increasing media exposure critiquing the legitimacy of the religion, its wealth continues to rise with a complex economic model blocking opponents from chasing its finances (Kent, 2011). So, how does this house of cards stay standing? Please note, for the purposes of analysis within this essay, The Church of Scientology and its subsidiaries will be assumed as a charlatan, profit-making business.."
